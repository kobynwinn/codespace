    "### ANOVA: Analysis of Variance\n",
    "The Analysis of Variance  (ANOVA) is a statistical method used to test whether there are significant differences between the means of two or more groups. ANOVA returns two parameters:\n",
    "- **F-test score**: ANOVA assumes the means of all groups are the same, calculates how much the actual means deviate from the assumption, and reports it as the F-test score. A larger score means there is a larger difference between the means.\n",
    "- **P-value<**:  P-value tells how statistically significant our calculated score value is.\n",
    "\n",
    "If our price variable is strongly correlated with the variable we are analyzing, we expect ANOVA to return a sizeable F-test score and a small p-value.\n",

    "\n",
    "To see if different types of 'drive-wheels' impact 'price', we group the data. If we get the 'drive-wheels' and 'price' columns from the dataframe and then use `.groupby(['drive-wheels])`, it will return a grouping of our data by 'drive-wheel'. Let's save it as a variable `gp_dw`."
